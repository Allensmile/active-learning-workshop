# Text Featurization

## Vector Space Models and Word Embeddings

The directory [`word_embeddings`](./word_embeddings) contains examples of training GloVe vectors in R for sentiment analysis, and examples of fine-tuning word vectors using the mittens package. It also provides examples of visualizing word embeddings with TensorBoard's projector plugin.

## Pre-Trained Word Vectors and Language Models

The directory [`lm_finetune`](./lm_finetune) contains modules and example notebooks for using pretrained word vectors for classification of attacks on wikipedia edits. The notebook is self-contained, and uses the functions loaded from the scripts therein.
